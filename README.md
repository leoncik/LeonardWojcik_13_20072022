# Argent Bank

Project carried out as part of the Front-End Web Development Career Path of OpenClassrooms.

### Notes

-   To run and watch the tests in the console, run : `yarn test`.
-   To get a coverage report while running the tests, run : `yarn coverage`. If you want to visualize the coverage report, you can run a live server (if you are using VSCode, I recommend using [this extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)) and use this url : http://127.0.0.1:5500/coverage/index.html
